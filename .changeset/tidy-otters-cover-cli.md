Expose all 55 generated TypeScript SDK operations and request inputs in the CLI, including product/customer/subscription updates, refunds, licenses, stats, moderation, customer credits, affiliate invitations, and revenue splits. Compile against the workspace SDK and enforce operation, input, command, and documentation parity in CI.

Add environment-key authentication, complete camelCase JSON/file/stdin request bodies, typed validation, page/cursor traversal, streaming NDJSON, global output options, structured trace-aware errors, and non-retrying writes. Preserve large credit amounts as strings.

Compatibility changes: subscription and discount lists now use the authoritative SDK search endpoints; subscription list JSON removes the old transaction-derived `note` field. Destructive commands (including updates and upgrades) require a TEST/LIVE confirmation interactively or `--yes` in automation and JSON/NDJSON modes. Existing command paths and aliases remain available.
